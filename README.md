LoRa TTN gateway met Orange Pi Zero en RAK831

This project describes how to make a TTN LoRa gateway with a RAK831 and an Orange Pi Zero.
For now the project is just a document (in Dutch) that describes the procedure to build a full blown LoRa gateway.
In a few weeks I will add an Englisch document.
